# KTA_robot_crawler
Project for my KTA ( IM0702) course in which we train a robot cralwer to crawl as fast as possible using the Q-learning algorithme

We started with the starter repo code "KTAI_Crawler_with_simple_Q_Learning" but when we changed the environment it was a lot easier to completely rewrite the code.
The file that we currently use is the "q_learning_gymnasium.ipynb"
